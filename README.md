### About Me

I'm passionate about using numerical models to study fluid flows, particularly in the context of geophysics.

### Previous Work

Previously, I have worked extensively on ice flow modeling, leveraging computational techniques (finite element modeling and optimization using the open source packages FEniCS and dolfin-adjoint) to study the dynamics of ice sheets and glaciers. This experience has provided me with a strong foundation in inverse problems and computational fluid dynamics. 

### Current Work

I'm currently working with USV (Unmanned Surface Vehicle) data from the tropical Pacific, utilizing computational techniques to analyze and derive insights from this valuable dataset.

### Some Highlights

Here are a few projects I'm working on:

- [Project Name](Link): Brief description of the project and its relevance to inverse problems in fluid flows.
- [Project Name](Link): Brief description of the project and how it integrates finite element modeling and optimization techniques.
- [Project Name](Link): Brief description of the project's focus on ice flow modeling and its potential applications.

Feel free to explore these repositories and provide feedback or suggestions. Collaboration is key in advancing our understanding of fluid dynamics and optimizing computational techniques.
