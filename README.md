- 👋 Hi, I’m @e-mcgeorge
- 👀 I’m interested in inverse problems in fluid flows.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning finite element modelling and optimal control usign FEniCS and dolfin-adjoint
- :snowflake: I hope to apply these modelling techniques to ice flow problems.

<!---
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my next project (inverse problems in lava flow).
- 📫 How to reach me: email at liz.mcgeorge@pg.canterbury.ac.nz
